# Learning-:
* We all became proficient in reading the code of team members.
* Our code writing style became cleaner as we had to think while writing code that other team member will be reading.
* We had to learn about many CSS properties that we didn’t know before.
* Our skills in Java Script and DOM manipulation became better.
* We all learned how to plan a project and execute that.
